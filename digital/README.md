## Digital Logic Simulator ##

This is a Flatpak build of https://github.com/hneemann/Digital, which is a Digital Logic Simulator.

## Runtime configuration ##

At least to me, it seems that the OpenJDK has some issues in picking up the correct font
for the UI. As a workaround, i added some configuration options, which are picked up at runtime.

To use it, modify the configuration file $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/digital-options.txt and specify
the default font there.
